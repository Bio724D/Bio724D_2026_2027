## Linux file system, typical structure

* Root = `/`
* Other disks (USB, etc) mounted under `/mnt`
* User directories under `/home`; your home directory at `/home/yourusername`
* System wide applications under `/usr/bin` (often linked to '/bin'); users can also install applications under `/usr/local/bin`
* User specific config files usually in home directory (hidden by default, use `ls -a` to see hidden files)
* `PATH` is an environment variable, settable from command line or `~/.profile`


## Commands for navigating the file system on Unix based systems 

NOTE: The following commands also work in Windows PowerShell

* `pwd` -- prints name of your "working" directory (i.e. the directory you're currently in)
* `ls` -- lists the contents of the working directory
* `cd` -- change directory
  * `cd Downloads`
  * `cd ~` (move to your home directory)
* `mkdir` -- make a new directory
  * `mkdir foo_dir`
  * `mkdir bar_dir`
* `rmdir` -- remove a directory (must be empty)
  * `rmdir bar_dir`  
* `rm` -- remove a file
  * `rm bar.txt`
* `cp` -- copy a file
  * `cp foo.txt foo_copy.txt`
* `mv` -- move a file or directory
  * `mv foo.txt baz.txt`
  * `mv foo_dir foo.dir`
* `cat` -- write the contents of a file to the terminal:
  * `cat foo.txt`
* `touch` -- change the modification time stamp of a file, or if file doesn't exist create an empty file
    - `touch newfile.txt`
* `df` -- report the amount of space used/available on the file sytem
    - `df -h`: the `-h` option reports space in "human readable" units (K = kilobyte, M = megabyte, G = gigabyte) instead of raw bytes


Side note: Why is it common to use names like `foo`, `bar`, and `baz` in examples? See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foobar


## Shortcuts for working with the file system

* `~` -- refers to the users home directory.  
  * `cd ~` = change to my home directory
  * `ls ~/*.txt` = list all files ending with the prefix `.txt` in your home directory
* `.` -- the current directory
  * `cd ./tmp` = move to the directory called `tmp` that is located in the directory the `cd` command is executed from.  
* `..` -- the directory above the current directory (if it exists)
  * `cd ..` = move up one level in the directory hierarchy.  For example if `pwd` is `/home/jsmith` then `cd ..` moves you to `/home`
*  `/` -- the root directory of the file system
  * `cd /data` = move to the `data` directory that is the subdirectory of the root
  * `ls /` = list all files and directories in the root directory


## Unzipping a Unix "tarball"

You're probably familiar with "zip" files -- a compression format that bundles files and directories into a single file that is convenient for sharing and backup.  Zip is just are one of many different compression algorithms / file formats.

On Unix derived systems the most common compressions format is what is colloquially known as a "tarball". Tarballs typically ending with the extension ".tar.gz".  Like a zip file, a tarball is a compressed collection of files and directories.  To unzip a tarball we invoke the `tar` command as follows:


```
tar xvzf example_directory.tar.gz
```




## Wildcards, globbing, and expansions

Most shells allow you to find or manipulate files whose names match a specified pattern. These patterns are somewhat similar to regular expressions, but not as rich or expressive in their capabilities.

### Wildcard patterns

The simplest approach is to use "wildcards". The process of matching with wildcards is colloquially known as "globbing".  

* `?` -- a question mark matches any single character
  * e.g. `ls pic?.jpg` -- lists files like `pic1.jpg`, `picA.jpg`, `pick.jpg`, etc.
* `*` -- an asterisk matches any number of characters
  * e.g. `ls *.jpg` -- lists all files whose names end in `.jpg`
  * e.g. `rm *junk*` -- removes all files whose names  contain `junk` as a substring; be very careful with globbing when removing files!
  * hint: use `ls` to check which files a wildcard pattern will match before using it to move, rename, or remove files

### Expansions

Expansions allow you to refer to multiple files at once by specifying either a **range** of numbers or letters or a **set** of characters or strings.

* `{ .. }` -- curly braces match a range of numbers or letters 
  * e.g. `f_{01..20].txt` -- refers to `f_01.txt`, `f_02.txt` . . . `f_20.txt`
  * e.g. `f_1{A..H}.txt` -- refers to `f_1A.txt`, `f_1A.txt` . . . `f_1H.txt`
* `[ ]` -- square brackets matches any one of the enclosed characters
  * e.g. `ls b[lr]*.jpg` -- lists all files whose name starts with `b` and whose second letter is either `l` or `r` and which end in `.jpg`. For example `blood.jpg`, `break.jpg`, but *not* `beak.jpg`
* `{ , }` -- curly braces with commas match any of the enclosed strings (see above for single characters)
  * e.g., `ls {DNA,RNA}_??.txt` -- lists files such as `DNA_27.txt` and `RNA_11.txt` but *not* `ANA_27.txt` or `333_27.txt` 


## Unix standard streams

Programs that follow Unix conventions and that execute in a shell have associated with them a set of what are called "standard streams", which you can think of as channels for communicating with the outside world. The three standard streams are referred to as:

* standard input (stdin)
* standard output (stdout)
* standard error (stderr)

By default, stdin is usually associated with keyboard input and stdout and stderr are the terminal display, but these can be changed as show below.


## Redirection and pipes


* `>` -- redirect the output operator. Sends the output of the command on the left to the file, device, or stream on the right. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten. If the file doesn't exist it will be created.
  - `echo "Hello, World!"` -- by default, stdout is associated with the terminal so executing this command command prints the result of the echo command to terminal display.
  - `echo "Hello, World!" > hello.txt` -- We're now redirecting stdout to a file called `hello.txt` (open this file to confirm that the contents are what is expected)

* `>>` -- append output operator. Like redirect operator but appends output to the specified file rather than creating/overwriting.
  
  ```
  echo "first line" >> lines.txt
  echo "second line" >> lines.txt
  ```


* `<` -- redirect input operator
  - The `tr` (translate) doesn't have a built in mechanism for reading from a file, only from stdio. However we can redirect a file to stdio use the `<` operator. For example, here we read text from the file `hello.txt` (created above) and translate all upper case letters to their lower case equivalents:

  ```
  tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' < hello.txt
  ```

  We can even chain together redirect operators like so:

  ```
  tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' < hello.txt > lower_hello.txt
  ```

  
* `|` -- pipe operator. The output of the command on the left is used as the input for the command on the right.
  - `ls *.jpg | wc -l` -- list all files ending in `.jpg` and count how many they are using the `wc` utility

## Unix core utilities

Most of the commmands below are described in detail in the [HTML manual for the GNU coreutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/index.html)

### Command-line options

Many Unix programs accept command-line optoins (switches) to control or modify their behavior.  Generally there are two styles: short switches designated with a single letter preceded by a hyphen (e.g. `ls -a`) or  keyword options designated by two hyphens followed by a keyword (e.g. `ls --all`). There are no hard and fast rules about how command-line options are used, but there are some conventions that most programs follow:

* When using multiple single letter options, multiple options can be written together after a single hyphen, e.g. `ls -la` == `ls -l -a`.

* Options can be be configured to accept arguments. 
  - Sometimes arguments are optional, but sometimes they are required 
  - In the case of single letter options the argument comes immediately after the switch or can be separated by a space, e.g. `cut -f 3 file.txt` == `cut -f3 file.txt` (cut the third column from each line; see below for info about `cut`)
  - When using keyword options, arguments can be separated by a space of an equal sign, e.g. `ls --hide="*.txt"` (lists files, hiding everything that matches the given pattern)
  - Some switches accept multiple arguments, e.g. `cut -f 1,3 file.txt`

* Many programs have a `--help` switch that prints out a brief summary of the standard usage pattern along with a list of the available options. A program's `man` pages are usually the best place to get more detailed explanations of how the options work. 

Futher discussion of command line switches can be found here: http://catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/ch10s05.html


### Navigating the file system and file manipulation


* `touch` -- change the modification time stamp of a file, or if file doesn't exist create an empty file
    - `touch newfile.txt`

* `df` -- report the amount of space used/available on the file sytem
    - `df -h`: the `-h` option reports space in "human readable" units (K = kilobyte, M = megabyte, G = gigabyte) instead of raw bytes


### Commonly used commands

* `less` -- a "pager" program for reading text one page at a time ("less is a better more"!). Useful when output spans multiple pages.  To advance/go back a page use `<space>/b` and to quit type `q`.
    - `less covid.txt`
    - `ls -l /bin/ | less`  -- notice that that the `ls` command here generates a long list of files. `less` helps us read the output one page at a time.
   
* `head` and `tail` -- output the first/last part of a file.  Both default to output 10 lines.
    - `head covid.gff`
    - `tail covid.gff`
    - `head -n 5 covid.gff`: show the first 5 lines of the file

* `cat` -- copies file(s) to stdout 
  - `cat file.txt`: write file to stdout
  - `cat file1.txt file2.txt > file1and2.txt`: concatenate two files

* `wc` -- counts bytes, characters, words, or lines
  - `wc -l file.txt`: count the number of lines in `file.txt`
  - `wc -m file.txt`: count the number of characters in `file.txt`

* `echo` -- send input text to standard output (stdout)
  - `echo Hello World!`
  - `echo -e 'Hello\nWorld!'`
    - Here we wrap the input in quotes so we can use the "backslash escape" representation of a newline (`\n`). The `-e` argument tells `echo` to interpret backsplash escapes appropriately. Another common backslash escape is `\t` to represent a tab character.
  - `echo Hello World > hello.txt`: send text to a new file `hello.txt` using the redirection operator.
  - `echo Hello World | wc -m`: send text to another command using the pipe operator (see `wc` below)


* `tr` -- translate (substitute) or delete characters in input. Note that unlike most commands `tr` will not take a file as an argument, so typically you would use `cat` to send the contents of a file through `tr`
  - `echo ATGCAA | tr A a`: substitute lower case "a" for uppercase "A"
  - `echo ATGCAA | tr -d A`: delete all "A" characters
  - `echo ATGCAA | tr ATGC TACG`: substitute each character in the first set ("ATGC") with the matching character in the second set ("TAGC"). 

* `rev` -- reverse input
  - `echo ATGCAAA | rev`
  - `echo ATGCAAA | rev | tr ATGC TACG` -- why might this be useful when working with representations of nucleotides?

* `sort` -- sorts lines of input
  - `sort file.txt` --  sort line in `file.txt`
  - `echo -e 'foo\nbar\nbaz\qux' | sort` 
  - `sort -k 3 -n columns.txt` -- sort numerically on the 3rd field (column) of the data
  - `sort -k 3 -n --debug columns.txt` -- the `--debug` option is useful when you're getting unexpected results. This highlights the field that `sort` is using in each line to do the sorting.
    - See [this page](./unexpected-sorting.md) and the [GNU FAQ](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/faq/coreutils-faq.html#Sort-does-not-sort-in-normal-order_0021) if you've doubled and triple checked your commands and yet getting unexpected sorting results

* `uniq` -- report/omit adjacent repeated lines.  The adjacency requirement means you usually need to sort the input first.
  - `echo 1235231443551 | fold -w 1 | sort | uniq`: get unique digits from input. Also try this without sorting first to see the difference.


* `grep` -- find regions of the input that match the specified pattern. Pattern matching uses what is known as "Regular Expressions" (regex). See a [short introduction to grep](https://informatics.fas.harvard.edu/short-introduction-to-grep.html) and the [Grep Manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/manual/grep.html) for more details.
  - `grep "A" genome.txt`: find all lines in `genome.txt` that include the letter "A". 
    * By default `grep` returns lines, rather than the matches themselves.
  - `grep -o "A" genome.txt`: the `-o` option tells grep to return only the matching parts of the input.
  - `grep -c "A" genome.txt`: count the number of matches in the input.
